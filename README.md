1: If you want to work on local machine
 First install PyCharm
 Create a new project 
 add those files to the project
 Execute them in order: first start by executing  only these two:  1-main , 2-yolo_to_json ,,,, you will get the json file and import it on label studio , it will provide you the predictions correctly but with so much points , that's why i added the process_all_files code to minimise the number of points to 4 . 
 try out again with : 1-main , 2-process_all_files , 3-yolo_to_json  ,, and see the difference.
 PS: you need to install the required libraries and adjust the paths accordingly.

 2: If you want to work on a virtual notebook you just need to ceate a notebook copy paste the code of the files, and adjust the paths accordingly.

 that's IT !! Easy peasy :)
